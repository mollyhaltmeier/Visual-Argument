My visual argument says “Breakdowns can be breakthroughs. It’s okay to cry!” which is a mental health reminder that I think would just be cute and uplifting for college campuses. I had a lot of fun making this because I felt like I was just doing advanced digital coloring. I wanted the design to be childish and playful and it was also important that it was colorful and fun while still having a cute message. I actually made all of this myself too which is cool and satisfying that I didn’t use other sources.

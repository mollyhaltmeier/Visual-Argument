For my visual project, right now I realize I have kind of nothing. I’ve honestly been battling with gimp and trying to move things around and struggling a little bit, but I don’t think it’s anything I can’t handle. I’m trying to do my project as from scratch as I can, or in other words just trying my best to take as little as possible from other sources. My visual is going to eventually say “Breakdowns can be breakthroughs. It’s okay to cry!” which is a mental health reminder that I think would just be cute and uplifting for college campuses.
